# Gilded Rose

This project allows us to maintain and update inventory for finest items purchased and sold in the market. Few items are: "Aged Brie", "Sulfuras", "Backstage passes", "Conjured" etc.

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item.

All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is.

At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item based on some predefined conditions.

## Setup

Install with `npm install` Run tests with `npm test`
